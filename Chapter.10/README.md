## Exercise 10.8
>We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they operate. Why doesn’t the use of back_inserter invalidate this claim?

Cause the back_inserter is a insert iterator, what iterator adaptor that generates an iterator that uses a container operation to add elements to a given container.

the algorithms don't change the size, but the iterator can change it by using the container operation.

## Exercise 10.10
>Why do you think the algorithms don’t change the size of containers?

@Mooophy: The aim of this design is to separate the algorithms and the operation provided by member function.

@pezy: Cause the library algorithms operate on iterators, not containers. Thus, an algorithm cannot (directly) add or remove elements.
